# 🌱Hello there!

I’m Ankita Karki, an Environmental Science graduate passionate about leveraging data analysis to drive meaningful insights and positive impact on sustainability challenges. This GitHub repository serves as my digital workspace, showcasing projects, experiments, and learnings at the intersection of environmental science and data analytics.

## 📊Why Data Analysis?
As someone deeply invested in addressing global environmental challenges, I believe that data-driven decision-making is key to creating sustainable solutions. My journey into data analysis began with applying statistical methods and geospatial tools to assess complex environmental datasets. Along the way, I’ve developed expertise in:

* Data Analysis & Visualization : Using Python, R, SQL, and Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights.
* Geospatial Analysis : Utilizing QGIS, R (sf, dplyr, leaflet), and GIS techniques to analyze spatial relationships and patterns.
* Database Management : Creating and managing databases in Excel, SQL, and relational database systems.
* Machine Learning : Exploring ML models and algorithms to uncover trends and predict outcomes.

Through this transition, I aim to bridge the gap between environmental science and data-driven strategies, contributing to more informed and impactful sustainability initiatives.

## 🚀Key Projects
Here are some highlights of my work:
### Carbon Market Data Integration
*  Developed a categorization system standardizing project types across three voluntary carbon markets using SQL databases and Python visualizations.
### Geospatial Overlap Analysis
* Conducted spatial intersection and multi-distance buffer analysis (5–15 km) on over 200 carbon credit projects using R (sf, dplyr, leaflet) and QGIS.
* Assessed geospatial proximity to identify potential overlaps between avoided deforestation and efficient cookstove projects.
